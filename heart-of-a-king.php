          <p>Heart of a King places visitors in the footsteps and emotional state of Charles I on the day of his execution in 1649. Visitors received a wooden, heart-shaped totem. The heart creates a haptic heartbeat that acts as a compass, increasing in strength when pointed to Charles' path. Following this compass, visitors trace Charles' final journey through St James Park and Whitehall, arriving in front of Banqueting House, the place of his execution where the heart ceases to beat.</p>
